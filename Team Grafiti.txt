Experience with deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Google heavily uses TensorFlow.

Knowledge of relevant ML techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks for image-like climate data, recurrent neural networks for time series).

Ability to train, validate, and deploy ML models.

III. Google-Specific Tools and Technologies (Exposure and Willingness to Learn):

Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Google's cloud services would be heavily utilized. Key components include:

Compute Engine: Virtual machines for running simulations.

Borg/Kubernetes: Google's container orchestration system (Kubernetes is the open-source version). Understanding containers (Docker) and container orchestration is valuable.

Tensor processing Unit (TPU): For large training, it would good if the candidate knows how to scale up the machine learning model efficiently with Google TPU.

IV. "Soft" Skills and Attributes (Essential for Success at Google):

Problem Solving: A strong ability to break down complex problems, analyze different approaches, and come up with effective solutions.

Experience with Google Cloud Platform and machine learning would be highly beneficial. The more domain knowledge and relevant experience the candidate possesses, the more valuable they will be to the team. Someone with a PhD in atmospheric science and excellent software engineering skills would be a particularly strong candidate.
