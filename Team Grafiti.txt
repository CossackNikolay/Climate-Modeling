Option B: Working Knowledge (Acceptable, but requires learning): A strong background in a quantitative field (physics, mathematics, engineering) with demonstrated interest and self-study in climate science. Willingness to learn the relevant physics and chemistry is crucial.

Option C: Limited Background (Less Common): A pure CS background could work for very specific roles (e.g., building visualization tools, optimizing data pipelines) where deep climate expertise isn't strictly required, but strong scientific computing skills are. However, this engineer would be heavily reliant on domain experts.

Geospatial Data Handling:

Experience working with large geospatial datasets (NetCDF, HDF5, GRIB are common formats).

Familiarity with GIS (Geographic Information System) tools and libraries (e.g., GDAL, QGIS, GeoPandas).

Understanding of map projections and coordinate systems.

Visualization:

Ability to represent a large amount of data.

Strong visual sense to create impactful visualization.

Familiar with at least one major data visualization tool, such as d3.js, Plotly, etc.

Experience with deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Google heavily uses TensorFlow.

Knowledge of relevant ML techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks for image-like climate data, recurrent neural networks for time series).

Ability to train, validate, and deploy ML models.

III. Google-Specific Tools and Technologies (Exposure and Willingness to Learn):

Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Google's cloud services would be heavily utilized. Key components include:

Compute Engine: Virtual machines for running simulations.

Cloud Storage: For storing and managing large datasets.

BigQuery: For analyzing large datasets (though custom climate analysis often requires more specialized tools).

Cloud Dataflow/Dataproc: For building data processing pipelines.

Vertex AI: Google's machine learning platform.

Earth Engine: Specifically designed for geospatial data analysis and visualization, likely highly relevant.

Internal Google Tools: Google has a vast ecosystem of internal tools and libraries (many of which are not publicly available). An ability to quickly learn and adapt to these tools is important.

Borg/Kubernetes: Google's container orchestration system (Kubernetes is the open-source version). Understanding containers (Docker) and container orchestration is valuable.

Tensor processing Unit (TPU): For large training, it would good if the candidate knows how to scale up the machine learning model efficiently with Google TPU.

IV. "Soft" Skills and Attributes (Essential for Success at Google):

Problem Solving: A strong ability to break down complex problems, analyze different approaches, and come up with effective solutions.

Learning Agility: The willingness and ability to learn new technologies and concepts quickly. The field of climate modeling, and Google's tools, are constantly evolving.

In Summary:

A SWE on a Google climate modeling team requires a blend of strong software engineering fundamentals, specialized knowledge in scientific computing and numerical methods, familiarity with geospatial data, and ideally some level of understanding of climate science itself. Experience with Google Cloud Platform and machine learning would be highly beneficial. The more domain knowledge and relevant experience the candidate possesses, the more valuable they will be to the team. Someone with a PhD in atmospheric science and excellent software engineering skills would be a particularly strong candidate.
